  <h1>Q2. DOMephant Formations</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>As you run away from the DOMephants, you notice something interesting. They seem to always travel in rows of DOMephants, and each row has a certain number of DOMephants. Each row of DOMephants is seem to be either an arithmetic sequence, a geometric sequence, or just a sequence of repeating numbers.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Write a JavaScript function <span class="code">pattern(x1, x2, x3…)</span> which returns an array of the number of DOMephants in the first 10 rows. Numbers of DOMephants in the first N rows are passed in as <em>individual</em> arguments. There will be at least 3 arguments, and at most 10. 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paste your function in the textarea below.</li>
      <li>You must take in number of DOMephants as individual arguments</li>
      <li>You must return a JavaScript Array</li>
      <li>If a pattern could be either an arithmetic series or a geometric series, returning either is fine</li>
    </ul>
