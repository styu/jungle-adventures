  <h1>Q5. The Worst Compass Ever</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Just as you feel like you've got an idea of where those DOMephants are hiding.. you realize.. you don't know where you are! You reach in to your right pocket only to feel a giant hole in your pants. Your compass is missing! No worries. With some simple HTML and CSS transformations, you're able to make yourself a new compass!.. except this one doesn't seem to work as well..</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Generate a round circle using HTML/CSS, and place an image of a 'needle' (provided) in the center. The Needle must spin forever in the middle of the circle, as shown in the sample output.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your CSS must demonstrate that your compass will spin for an infinite number of times</li>
      <li>The circle has a diameter of 400px. The Needle has a width of 20px.</li>
      <li><em>No</em>, you may not use JavaScript. You must only use HTML/CSS</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
