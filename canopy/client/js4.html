  <h1>Q4. Flying Arrows of Doom</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>You run away in panic, but as you turn around you see arrows being launched at you! To better avoid these
  arrows, you decide to simulate the path trajectory of these arrows using JavaScript.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
  	Create a flying arrow animation using JavaScript, that replicates (or looks extremely similar to) the expected output shown below. 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your arrows must fall with some sort of acceleration (simulating gravity)</li>
      <li>Your arrows must also rotate realistically as it approaches the ground</li>
      <li>Your arrows must always stop once it has reached the edge of the window. We will <em>resize</em>
      your window size to verify that is the case</li>
      <li>Your arrows should have a randomized horizontal velocity, although the majority of the arrows should land within the confines of the window screen. (It's alright if a couple of them go offscreen)</li>
      <li><em>No</em> you may not use a physics engine. Or Flash.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  Once you are done, get a <em>Checkofficer</em> to check you off.</p>
