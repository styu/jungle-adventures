  <h1>Q3. Mission Report</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Time to brush up on some paperwork. What are DOMephants? We just don't know. What is the purpose of a DOMephant?.. Luckily you can format yourself a nice briefing sheet using your plentiful knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Style a document to look like the expected output. We don't expect everything to be perfect, but basic features should be there. We have provided you with the necessary images.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The text should be in a white rectangle (paper) on a yellow background (folder)</li>
      <li>The top left hand corner must have a polaroid of the DOMephant. Text must wrap around this image.</li>
      <li>A paperclip must be in the top left hand corner, in front of the polaroid and the text.</li>
      <li>The text must be in two columns</li>
      <li>There must be enough margin/padding appropriately such that your output looks similar to what is shown below</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
