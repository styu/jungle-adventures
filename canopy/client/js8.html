  <h1>Q3. Not-So-Secret Entry</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>DOMephant security measures are pretty easy to get around. As you approach one of their gates, you realize all it is is a lot of button mashing. There's a box that even tells you which button to mash! Quick!</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Write a program to 'click' the buttons such that you get 1000 of them correct in a row. The button you should be clicking is indicated in the div with id <span class="code">should-click</span>. Fetch the button number from there. Once you have gotten 1000 correct in a row, this question will automatically be checked off. 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ID of the span containing what to click is <span class="code">should-click</span></li>
      <li>The ID of button0 is <span class="code">b0</span></li>
      <li>The ID of button1 is <span class="code">b1</span></li>
    </ul>
