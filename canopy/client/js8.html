  <h1>Q8. BONUS: The Meteor Attack</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>This is a <em>BONUS</em> </p>
  <p>A meteor has crashed into the jungle and all cell networks are down. You're standing next to the meteor and want to find your friends. Luckily you have an advanced radio runs Meteor and so does everyone else. You need to implement a low-level transport protocol for communication between two radios. The network guarantees to deliver a batch of messages reliably: everything sent in one batch will arrive but the order of messages inside batch may be shuffled. Every message is encoded as a 32-bit signed integer, one batch may look like: 
[10, 0, 42, -1024, 2147483647]</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Write a program to 'click' the buttons such that you get 1000 of them correct in a row. The button you should be clicking is indicated in the div with id <span class="code">should-click</span>. Fetch the button number from there. Once you have gotten 1000 correct in a row, this question will automatically be checked off. 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ID of the span containing what to click is <span class="code">should-click</span></li>
      <li>The ID of button0 is <span class="code">b0</span></li>
      <li>The ID of button1 is <span class="code">b1</span></li>
    </ul>
