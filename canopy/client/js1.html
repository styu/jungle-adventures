  <h1>Q1. JavaScript Alert</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Apparently, the DOMephants do not like their photos taken. It's clear that they're ashamed of their unclosed tags, use of tables, and generally invalid markup.. but to make up for this, they seem to be experts at JavaScript. As they chase after you, you must create a distraction. An HTML sign is not enough... create an Alert!
  </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Use JavaScript to fetch the contents of the div with id <span class="code">distraction-sign</span> and display the content in an alert
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must produce an alert using <span class="code">alert()</span></li>
      <li>All your JavaScript must be in a separate JavaScript file</li>
      <li>You may not use any libraries other than JQuery</li>
      <li><em>No</em> you may not copy the phrase into JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
