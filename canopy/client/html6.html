  <h1>Q6. Responsive DOMephants</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>The DOMephants are more clever than you think... It's been minutes now, and you still haven't seen any traces of... WAIT! THERE IT IS! You quickly full-screen your window.. and it disappears! What's going on? You quickly re-resize your browser window, and you notice that it appears again. These tricky DOMephants. They've hidden themselves in the responsive nature of web-design nowadays, and can only be seen at a certain window size... </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Display an image of the DOMephant on screen only when 450px &lt;= window-size &lt; 500px. The text that is displayed above it should also change as shown in the sample output. 
  </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Text must always be in white, 24px, aligned-center in the same location above the DOMephant</li>
    	<li>The DOMephant must be centered</li>
    	<li>The DOMephant should not appear when the window-size is 500px or greater</li>
    	<li>The DOMephant should not appear when the window-size is less than 400px</li>
    	<li><em>No</em>, you may not use JavaScript. You must only use HTML/CSS</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  	Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
