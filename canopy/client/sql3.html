  <h1>Q3. Playing with Profiles</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Now that you've gotten into the DOMephant's systems (again), you've discovered how they communicate with each other. It seems like each of them has a profile, on which they post a bunch of messages. In order to gain more information about the DOMephants and to disrupt their communications, you decide to attack the profile pages.
  </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    In this challenge, you'll actually have to log in, as you have the option of posting more messages to the profile. We don't want your postings to affect other competitors. Please register using your team name. After you've logged in, go ahead and play around with the profile page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your objective is to cause the page to create an <span class="code">alert</span> every time the page is visited. The contents of the <span class="code">alert</span> should be the same as the secret that is displayed at the top of the page.
  </p>
      <ul>
      <li>You must produce an alert when the page is visited</li>
      <li>The contents of the alert must contain the secret displayed on the page</li>
      <li>The contents are stored on your browser -- you may not extract the secret from the DOM</li>
      <li>The alert must be shown as soon as you visit the page -- no other actions (such as clicking or typing into the console) are allowed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: </em>The secret at the top of the page should read elephant-tails.</p>
