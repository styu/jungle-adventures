  <h1>Q6. A and B</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Well, congrats on getting here. This page is going to be fun. It's got nothing to do with DOMephants. But it's still got to do with security, and how Chrome handles it.
  </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
      The objective is simply that, when visiting the page, the page displays an alert with the contents "hello world". There should be no action required to display the message other than visiting the page (with the correct url).
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must produce an alert when the page is visited</li>
      <li>The contents of the alert must contains the string 'hello world'</li>
      <li>The alert must be shown as soon as you visit the page -- no other actions (such as clicking or typing into the console) are allowed</li>
    </ul>
