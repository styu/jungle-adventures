  <h1>Q7. The Photo Evidence</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Finally, you've managed to capture a photo of the DOMephant... However, the photo doesn't seem to look that impressive. No worries, some CSS and image filters can easily fix that. No, this is not Instagram... this is history in the making! </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Replicate the image shown in sample output by following the steps below.
  </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Add a sepia filter to the original image.</li>
    	<li>Increase the brightness of the image by 200%</li>
    	<li>Add a white, 10px border around the image</li>
    	<li>Add a box shadow with a 10px blur, 0px spread, and a 1px, 1px relative shadow position. Make the opacity of this shadow 0.5.</li>
    	<li>Add a 'vignette' effect. Use a radial gradient that is black with an opacity going from 100% to 0%.</li>
    	<li><em>No</em>, you may not use Photoshop. This must all be done with HTML/CSS</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  	Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
