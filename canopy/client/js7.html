  <h1>Q7. Lost in the Jungle</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>You are escaping from the DOMephants, and you need to find your way through the jungle.  To find your way out, you need to find all the paths from your location to where you left your electric scooter at the edge of the jungle.  </p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
  	Find the number of possible paths in the given grid.  
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A path can only contain a specific location at most once. Therefore, there are no loops, and a path cannot have backtracking. </li>
      <li>The grid will be represented as a 2D array.  1 represents walkable path, and 0 represents squares that cannot be walked on. </li>
      <li>The start and end locations will be (0, 0) and (11, 11) of the given grid respectively. </li>
      <li>The starter code comes with a skeleton file named js7starter.js. The file comes with a function named find_all_paths that accepts a grid, the start vertex, and the end vertex. You may change the method signature or write your own. </li>
      <li>We have also included some functions that will draw your grid given a 2D array of 0s and 1s.  Walkable paths are represented in gray. </li>
    </ul>

  Once you are done, get a <em>Checkofficer</em> to check you off.</p>
