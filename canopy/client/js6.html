  <h1>Q6. Fast Moving Critters</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>No one really understands how DOMephants manage to move so fast, and are able to chase after you. To understand them better, build a DOMephant simulator using HTML and JavaScript. This DOMephant simulator will allow you to control an image of a DOMephant with your arrow keys! Excellent...</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
  	Create a simple HTML/JavaScript page that contains an image of a DOMephant that can be moved around the screen using the Arrow Keys. Be sure to flip the DOMephant when it's moving left vs. right. An expected output is shown below 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not worry about conditions after it moves past the screen</li>
      <li>The animation of the DOMephant moving should be fairly smooth and not choppy</li>
      <li>You should not need to edit the CSS file</li>
      <li>The DOMephant should flip based on if it's moving left/right. It should stay facing that direction on key release</li>
      <li>Other keys should not move the DOMephant</li>
      <li>Hint: You may want to use setInterval()</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  Once you are done, get a <em>Checkofficer</em> to check you off.</p>
