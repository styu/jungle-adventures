  <h1>Q4. Shopping List</h1>
  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
  <p>Hm.. you seem to be missing something. You pull up your shopping list, but before you can even read it, you'll need to format it to be something that looks remotely impressive.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    Style the table to look and react as shown in the sample output. Be sure to have alternating table colors (use pseudo classes). Hovering over a row should make the row have a blue background.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There must be a white space between table fields</li>
      <li>The table must be horizontally centered</li>
      <li>Table rows must alternate colors</li>
      <li>Table header row must be white and the font bold</li>
      <li>Hovering over a row must change it to blue</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Once you are done, get a <em>checkofficer</em> to check you off.
